# Stock Price Alert
 
* A python program that collects the most recent stock market data of a given company
and notifies the user if the stock price has changed by more than 4 percent. 

* The program prints the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day. Then, it calculates the 
change in percentage between the opening and closing amounts. If the stock has risen or fallen by
more than 4 percent, the user receives an email alerting them of this change.

For gmail users activate two-factor authentication and create an app password and add that to an
environment variable which your script will have access to. This way not only will you be avoiding
your actual email password, but even your app password is not used in the program.

### Customization:
According to the user's needs, you would be able to manipulate the code to access daily, weekly,
monthly, or even minute-by-minute data from the stock market for your chosen company. Access to this dataframe
entails that you can select and compare stock data for any company at any particular time.
